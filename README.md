# Warren

> *For Ann - who brings light to every burrow*

A blazingly fast, keyboard-driven file manager built specifically for Hyprland.

## About

Warren is a modern file manager designed from the ground up for tiling window manager users who live in Hyprland. Like the intricate network of tunnels in a rabbit warren, this file manager helps you navigate your filesystem with speed and efficiency.

This project is dedicated to Ann Rabbets (AnnieRabbets), whose strength and spirit inspire every line of code.

## Why Warren?

Existing file managers are built for traditional desktop environments. Warren embraces the Hyprland philosophy:
- **Keyboard-first navigation** - Mouse optional, never required
- **Hyprland-native integration** - IPC communication, workspace awareness, custom window rules
- **Performance-focused** - Written in Go for speed and efficiency
- **Minimal and purposeful** - No bloat, just what you need

## Project Status

## Philosophy

> "A warren is never just a collection of holes. It's a community, a system, a home."

Warren isn't just another file manager. It's built for people who:
- Use Hyprland and want deep integration
- Prefer keyboard over mouse
- Value speed and efficiency
- Appreciate minimal, purposeful design
